# Physarum_polycephalum_Budapest_transportation_network
A network analysis of Budapestâ€™s public transport system using a Physarum polycephalum-inspired model. We simulate slime mould network growth, assess resilience to targeted attacks, and compare results with the real system to explore efficiency and robustness improvements.
