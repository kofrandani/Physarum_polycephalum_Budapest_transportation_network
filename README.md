# Physarum_polycephalum_Budapest_transportation_network
Inspired by the adaptive behavior of Physarum polycephalum, this project models the Budapest public transport network using slime mould-inspired algorithms. Building on the work of Raphael Kay (2022), we simulate network formation and evaluate the efficiency and resilience of both the actual and modeled systems through targeted attack scenarios and network analysis metrics.

Code and data are not publicly available due to confidentiality agreements and ethical obligations, including respect for the original research by Raphael Kay.
